// Direction Reduction
// Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…
// … a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.

// Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

// How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.
// The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):

// ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
// or
// { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
// or
// [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
// You can immediately see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:

// ["WEST"]
// or
// { "WEST" }
// or
// [West]
// Other examples:
// In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"], the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH" is going north and coming back right away.

// The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).

//My Solution
function dirReduc(arr) {
  arr.forEach(dirDetec);
  return arr;
}
function dirDetec(item, index, arr) {
  if (
    (item === "NORTH" && arr[index + 1] === "SOUTH") ||
    (item === "SOUTH" && arr[index + 1] === "NORTH") ||
    (item === "EAST" && arr[index + 1] === "WEST") ||
    (item === "WEST" && arr[index + 1] === "EAST")
  ) {
    arr.splice(index, 2);
    return dirReduc(arr);
  }
  return arr;
}

//Best Solution
function dirReduc(plan) {
  var opposite = {
    NORTH: "SOUTH",
    EAST: "WEST",
    SOUTH: "NORTH",
    WEST: "EAST",
  };
  return plan.reduce(function (dirs, dir) {
    if (dirs[dirs.length - 1] === opposite[dir]) dirs.pop();
    else dirs.push(dir);
    return dirs;
  }, []);
}
